Interfaces and basic implementations of the repository pattern.

This help building a persistence layer, and offers repositories prepared for JPA and JDBC, along several sample Spring-based configurations, showing how to set them up for Hibernate, Eclipselink, Spring JDBC and several databases.

## Features

Offers the following helpful classes:
- Repository for the basic JPA API
- Repository for Spring's JDBC API
- Spring-based examples, as part of the tests, showing how to set up a persistence layer for several databases

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
$ mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Usage

The application is coded in Java, using Maven to manage the project.

It is a Java library, meant to be included as a dependency on any project which may want to make use of it.

### Prerequisites

The project has been tested on the following Java versions:
* JDK 7
* JDK 8
* OpenJDK 7

All other dependencies are handled through Maven, and noted in the included POM file.

### Installing

The recommended way to install the project is by setting it up as a dependency. To get the configuration information for this check the [Bintray repository][bintray-repo], or the [Maven Central Repository][maven-repo].

It is always possible installing it by using the usual Maven command:

```
$ mvn install
```

### Testing

Several of the integration tests included in the project require running databases. While these are taken care by the continuous integration environment, when running the project in local they should be prepared manually, and so it is not recommended trying to run the integration tests, as this may end with several failure warnings.

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
