/**
 * Provides interfaces and basic implementations for the repository pattern.
 * <p>
 * This pattern is similar to a DAO, as it allows accessing data through CRUD
 * operations, hiding the source of this data.
 * <p>
 * It can be hard to find differences between a DAO and a repository, but the
 * first is used as an interface between the application and a table on a
 * database, while the second is a domain driven pattern, which may or not be
 * linked to a database.
 * <h2>Interfaces</h2>
 * <p>
 * The {@link com.wandrell.pattern.repository.Repository Repository} offers the
 * most basic implementation of this pattern, using the general CRUD operations.
 * <p>
 * But the {@link com.wandrell.pattern.repository.FilteredRepository
 * FilteredRepository} additionally allows acquiring just a subset of data from
 * the repository, with the use of the
 * {@link com.wandrell.pattern.repository.FilteredRepository#getCollection(Object)
 * getCollection} and the
 * {@link com.wandrell.pattern.repository.FilteredRepository#getEntity(Object)
 * getEntity} methods. Both of them require a filter class, the difference being
 * that {@code getCollection} returns a collection of entities, while
 * {@code getEntity} returns just a single entity.
 * <p>
 * Each implementation will take care of which type of object will it use for
 * filtering, and how it will apply such filter. But an example is the
 * {@link com.wandrell.pattern.repository.QueryData QueryData} interface, which
 * stores data for generating queries similar to the SQL ones.
 * <h2>Implementations</h2>
 * <p>
 * A basic implementation of the {@code FilteredRepository},
 * {@link com.wandrell.pattern.repository.CollectionRepository
 * CollectionRepository}, offers a simple and fast way of creating the simplest
 * possible repository.
 * <p>
 * It stores entities inside a {@code Collection}, and filters them through
 * Guava classes, specifically it requires a <a href=
 * "http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Predicate.html"
 * >Predicate</a> which the entities to be returned should validate.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, there is a default implementation of {@code QueryData},
 * {@link com.wandrell.pattern.repository.DefaultQueryData DefaultQueryData},
 * which just serves to ease using said interface.
