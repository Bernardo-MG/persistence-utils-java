/**
 * Implementation of {@code FilteredRepository} prepared to work with basic JPA
 * classes.
 * <p>
 * This repository uses JPQL queries, applying a simple JPA templating
 * mechanism.
 * <p>
 * For example, a query could be like this:
 * <p>
 * {@code SELECT employee FROM Employee employee WHERE id = :id}
 * <p>
 * Meaning that the query expects a parameter {@code id}, which will take the
 * place of the {@code :id} placeholder.
 * <p>
 * Both the query and the parameters will be received on a {@code QueryData}
 * object, which comes from the <a
 * href="https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/java-patterns">Java Patterns
 * library</a>.
 * <p>
 * An initial query is required, this will be used when acquiring all the
 * values, and could be something like:
 * <p>
 * {@code SELECT employee FROM Employee employee"}
 * <p>
 * As note to take into consideration, when using the
 * {@link #add(PersistenceEntity) add} and the
 * {@link #update(PersistenceEntity) update} methods both will work the same. If
 * the received entity lacks a code it will be added into the database,
 * otherwise the stored entity will be updated.
