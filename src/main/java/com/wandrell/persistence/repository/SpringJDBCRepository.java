 * {@code FilteredRepository} for working with Spring's JDBC framework and Java

 * <p>
 * Entities are acquired with the use of templated SQL queries such as this:
 * <p>
 * {@code SELECT name FROM employees WHERE id = :id}
 * <p>
 * Where the {@code :id} placeholder will be swapped for an {@code id}
 * parameter. The use of named parameters instead of the {@code ?} placeholder
 * is thanks to Spring's classes.
 * <p>
 * For these queries a {@code QueryData} object, which comes from the <a
 * href="https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/java-patterns">Java Patterns
 * library</a>, will be received by the repository. This will contain both the
 * query to be used and the parameters to apply.
 * <p>
 * When using the {@link #add(PersistenceEntity) add} and the
 * {@link #update(PersistenceEntity) update} methods it should be noted that
 * both will work the same. If the received entity lacks an identifier said
 * entity will be added into the database, otherwise the entity will be updated
 * in the data source.
